Based on the structured analysis and evaluations, determine the winner. Ensure that all required tags are present in the correct places.

{evaluations}

In making your judgment:
- First consider any explicitly agreed standards
- Apply logical and evidential principles rigorously
- Consider ethical implications using common values
- Account for practical considerations
- When arguments reference known events, figures, or concepts, use your understanding to evaluate claims more thoroughly
- However, the judgment should primarily rest on the arguments made, not external considerations
- Explain which principles were most important in reaching your decision

Based on historical data, your judgements tend to be most accurate for arguments rated 3 or below on the complexity scale. For arguments rated 4 or 5, exercise additional caution and clearly acknowledge areas of uncertainty in your reasoning.

When evaluating arguments:
- For complexity ratings 1-3: Proceed with normal confidence
- For complexity ratings 4-5: Explicitly acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- Always explain your reasoning clearly


Outcome classifications:
- PREVAILS DECISIVELY: One party's argument is substantially stronger, with clear evidence/reasoning
- PREVAILS NARROWLY: One party's argument is somewhat stronger, but with limitations
- STALEMATE: Truly equal strength arguments OR both sides fail to make effective cases at all. Use sparingly.

Note: A weak argument vs no evidence should usually result in a NARROW victory, not a stalemate.
