PRINCIPLES FOR ARGUMENT EVALUATION

1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

Stated Terms of Reference
- Explicitly agreed-upon rules, assumptions, or criteria take precedence
- If parties have accepted specific standards of evidence or success, apply these strictly
- Consider the original context and purpose of the debate

Logical Coherence
- Arguments must be internally consistent
- Premises should support conclusions
- Watch for logical fallacies (ad hominem, false equivalence, etc.)
- Correlation vs causation must be properly distinguished

Common Sense
- Accept widely known facts without requiring explicit proof
- Prefer simpler explanations over complex ones (Occam's Razor)
- Consider practical feasibility and real-world constraints
- If one interpretation is clearly more reasonable, prefer it

2. EVIDENCE EVALUATION

Reliable Evidence
- Prefer primary sources over secondary ones
- Value peer-reviewed or independently verified claims
- Consider the methodology behind statistical claims
- Weight recent evidence more heavily than older data
- Look for consensus among experts in relevant fields

Superforecasting Principles
- Break complex claims into testable sub-components
- Use reference classes from similar historical cases
- Consider base rates and prior probabilities
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly
- Update assessments when new evidence emerges

Source Credibility
- Track record of accuracy matters
- Apply extra scrutiny to claims from sources with history of misleading statements
- Consider potential conflicts of interest
- Value domain expertise in relevant areas
- Distinguish between fact claims and opinion/interpretation

3. ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

Common Values (when explicit principles aren't stated)

Welfare
- Prefer outcomes that increase overall well-being
- Consider both immediate and long-term effects
- Account for both physical and psychological impacts
- Prevention of harm outweighs creation of benefit

Utilitarianism
- Greater good for greater numbers
- Consider distribution of benefits and harms
- Account for marginality (helping those with less counts more)
- Balance individual rights with collective benefit

Freedom and Autonomy
- Respect individual choice and self-determination
- Consider consent and informed decision-making
- Balance personal freedom with harm to others
- Value preservation of future choices

Fairness and Justice
- Similar cases should be treated similarly
- Process matters as much as outcomes
- Consider equity and accessibility
- Account for historical context and existing inequalities

4. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Feasibility
- Consider practical implementation challenges
- Account for resource constraints
- Value solutions that can be implemented incrementally
- Consider scalability and sustainability

Proportionality
- Response should be proportional to the problem
- Costs should be justified by benefits
- Consider unintended consequences
- Balance short-term and long-term impacts

Resilience
- Prefer robust solutions that work under various scenarios
- Consider adaptability to changing circumstances
- Value redundancy and fail-safes in critical areas
- Account for worst-case scenarios

These principles should be applied contextually and weighted according to their relevance to the specific debate. No single principle is absolute; they must be balanced against each other based on the circumstances of each case.
