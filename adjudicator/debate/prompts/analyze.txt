Analyze this debate text:

{text}

Apply the provided evaluation principles to identify and classify arguments. Pay special attention to:
- Explicitly stated terms or standards
- Logical structure and evidence quality
- Relevant ethical considerations
- Practical implications

Note: If the debate text includes more than one participant on any side, determine if they form cohesive teams based on their arguments. When teams are identified, assign a brief, recognizable team name (reflecting the contributing participants) using the tags <p1> and <p2>. Teams may vary in size.

You need to identify argument participants and group them into teams when applicable. If names are not provided, create them.
IMPORTANT: For the overall analysis, refer to the primary sides as P1 and P2 except within the designated team assignment tags.

Provide a structured response in this exact format:

TITLE
Create a catchy, brief, newspaper-style title that captures the essence of the debate:
<debate_title>{{Create a compelling title here}}</debate_title>

BELLIGERENTS
If teams are identified due to multiple participants:
<p1>team_name_1</p1>|<p2>team_name_2</p2>
Otherwise:
<p1>text_party_1</p1>|<p2>text_party_2</p2>

ARGUMENTS FOR P1
Label each argument A1, A2, etc. For each argument, provide:
1. Clear statement of the argument
2. One of these strength annotations:
   [CORE] - A central claim that other arguments build upon
   [STRONG] - Could be decisive if not effectively countered
   [SUPPORTING] - Reinforces another argument (specify which)
   [WEAK] - Minor point that might only matter in a close case
3. Add *Qant* before any claim that depends on quantities or measurements
4. Explanation of why you chose that strength level

Example:
A1. P1's contract explicitly states delivery must be within 30 days
[CORE] This is the fundamental basis of the breach of contract claim

A2. *Qant* Building more highways would significantly reduce traffic congestion in urban areas
[STRONG] Makes a testable claim about infrastructure impact that requires quantitative analysis

IMPLICATIONS FOR P1
- If A1 is true, then {{consequence}}
- A2 depends on A1 because {{reason}}
- A3 strengthens A2 by showing {{connection}}

SUMMARY FOR P1
<s1>Concise summary of their overall position and how arguments connect</s1>

ARGUMENTS FOR P2
(Same format as above, using B1, B2, etc.)

IMPLICATIONS FOR P2
(Same format as above)

SUMMARY FOR P2
<s2>Concise summary of their overall position and how arguments connect</s2>
