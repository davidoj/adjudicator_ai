Analyze this debate text:

{text}

Apply the provided evaluation principles to identify and classify arguments. Pay special attention to:
- Explicitly stated terms or standards
- Logical structure and evidence quality
- Relevant ethical considerations
- Practical implications

You need to identify argument participants. If names are not provided, create them.

Provide a structured response in this exact format:

BELLIGERENTS
<p1>{text_party_1}</p1>|<p2>{text_party_2}</p2>

ARGUMENTS FOR <p1>
Label each argument A1, A2, etc. For each argument, provide:
1. Clear statement of the argument
2. One of these strength annotations:
   [CORE] - A central claim that other arguments build upon
   [STRONG] - Could be decisive if not effectively countered
   [SUPPORTING] - Reinforces another argument (specify which)
   [WEAK] - Minor point that might only matter in a close case
3. Explanation of why you chose that strength level

Example:
A1. The contract explicitly states delivery must be within 30 days
[CORE] This is the fundamental basis of the breach of contract claim

A2. The delay caused significant financial losses
[STRONG] Demonstrates material harm from the breach

IMPLICATIONS FOR <p1>
- If A1 is true, then {{consequence}}
- A2 depends on A1 because {{reason}}
- A3 strengthens A2 by showing {{connection}}

(Same format as above, using B1, B2, etc.)

IMPLICATIONS FOR <p2>
(Same format as above)
