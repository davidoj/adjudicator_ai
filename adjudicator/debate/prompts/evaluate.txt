Given these structured arguments, analyze their interactions:

{structured_arguments}

Apply the evaluation principles to assess:
- How well arguments meet logical and evidential standards
- Whether any agreed standards or terms of reference are satisfied
- Relevant ethical considerations from common values
- Practical feasibility and implications

When evaluating:
- Focus primarily on the arguments and evidence presented
- When evaluating factual claims:
  * Consider whether a claim is challenged by the other party
  * If an extraordinary claim goes unchallenged, this often suggests it is accepted as true
  * Look for internal consistency - does the opposing party's argument implicitly accept the claim?
  * Consider whether a claim matches common knowledge about scale and scope
  * When exact numbers are disputed, look for agreement about rough magnitude
  * Be especially careful about claims that both:
    - Are central to the argument
    - Are specifically disputed by the other party
- For arguments marked with *Qant*, attempt to:
  * Verify any explicit quantities given
  * Make reasonable estimates where quantities are implied but not stated
  * Consider relevant base rates and comparative statistics
  * Note when quantitative claims lack sufficient support
  * Always contextualize numbers:
    - Compare to relevant baselines (e.g., total budget, GDP, population)
    - Break down large numbers into more comprehensible units
    - Consider the magnitude of impacts, not just the direction
    - Considering costs alongside benefits often helps to clarify the magnitude of each number
- If arguments reference broader context (events, people, concepts) that you're familiar with, incorporate that knowledge to enrich the analysis
- However, maintain focus on the specific claims made rather than shifting to tangential debates
- If an argument depends on other claims, and these claims have been convincingly refuted, then the argument itself is (probably) defeated
- Note when your contextual knowledge significantly influences the evaluation
- Avoid human errors from avoiding quantification. Be scope sensitive, pay attention to base rates. If you need to estimate a number, do so.
- Be skeptical of unquantified tradeoff claims when responding to quantitative arguments
- Recognize when an argument identifies a mathematical or logical problem that requires resolution
- If resolution is beyond your expertise, refrain from making a judgment

Remember that the participants do not necessarily have a position on every point; write "no position" if that is the case.
